# **Python Project Tasks Breakdown**

## **TASK 0**

Instruction 1: Write a shell script that runs a Python Script?

**NB:** Shell scripts require the first line to be a shebang: **#!** followed by usr/bin/python3
which is the path to interpreter used to parse or execute file.

**Note:** Not all operating systems use bash as their primary interpreter hence differnt
users can opt to use a different like ZSH

In the task, we use python3 interpreter to execute our file, in which it runs python code inserted in
file.

Instruction2: The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE

- Environment variables are specific to ecosystem such as Ubuntu 20.04. This variables store values.

- In the above instance we need to store our file name to a var variable i.e

- To set an ENV variable in Linux we use keyword **export**

``` export $PYFILE = 0-run```

- In the above code sample we have declared an env variable PYFILE and passed a value which is the name of our file.
