# **Introduction Python Programming Language**

Python is a general purpose, high level programming language which was created by Guido van Rossum
in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation.

It was designed with code readability in mind and its syntax allows programmers to express their
concepts in fewer line of codes.

There are two major Python versions: **Python 2** and **Python 3**. Both are quite different.
